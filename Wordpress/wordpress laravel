wordpress laravel

Hey there! Thanks for getting in contact with me. The site you'd be working on is loveabl.com (NSFW obviously lol) and I started it over a year ago. It was originally based in C# with .NET, but that platform was a huge mistake so we rebuilt it from the ground up with a new developer using PHP and Laravel instead. But the development has since stalled.

So if you were the developer, what things would you do differently and change? What do you think is the main value (wow factor) that a site like this (a user-upload porn clip-site) has to offer to viewers? What's the main channel you would use to try to rapidly grow the site's user base?

Wantable.com looks pretty cool; how much work did you do on that site? Like how big was the team, what platform did you use, and what all was involved in developing it? It's a pretty cool business idea.

HI Gabe, I have two sites lakengren.com and yankeetrace.com. I would like for someone to look over both and tell me optimizations I need done. Currently the sites have large videos(not my call, client requested). However. I want to make sure the bones of both sites are buttoned up and ready to for handover to client. So any loading issues, SEO problems, etc.

Basically I want another set of experienced eyes on it.

Let me know if your interested. Thank you.

I dont quite grasp. Images in Wordpress, sizing them to the correct size.
