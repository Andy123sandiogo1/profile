Wordpress developer
-----------------------------------------
I have a news ticker plugin installed on a widget at the top of every page. It's causing a few problems.

1. CSS on ipad and mobile is a mess, would like that cleaned up.
2. If you scroll down and then back up, the news ticker copy becomes jumbled, also the menu items to the right of the logo become unclickable. If you keep scrolling up and down sometimes it fixes itself and sometimes it doesnt. The menu hovers may have something to do with the css as well. 

Would love a fix ASAP, Thanks!
