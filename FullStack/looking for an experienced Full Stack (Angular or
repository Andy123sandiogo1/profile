Hello.

I'm a professional web developer with 5+ years of experience.
Over the last 5 years I've developed & participated 5+ projects using HTML, CSS, Angular, React.js, PHP, Laravel, Wordpress,  Yii, etc..

You can check my works here:
www.wantable.com
www.corva.ai
www.juniper.net
www.tynker.com
www.shmoop.com

As an expert in core javascript, various front-end MVC (Angular, React) and PHP frameworks(Yii/Laravel), I think I'm right candidate for this position.

I've got through your requirements 100% and I'm sure I can deliver the quality and productivity.

I worked for private company for 5 years before I turned into freelancer so I have good communication skills, team spirit, consistency & never give up. 

I'm familiar and trained at scrum and agile methodology and use git for version control.

Could we possibly meet and discuss more details about this project?

I'd appreciate if you can afford some time for me.
