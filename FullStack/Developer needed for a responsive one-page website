Developer needed for a responsive one-page website

We're looking to convert an existing vector design into a static, responsive, one-page website using HTML+CSS. I anticipate the project will take less than one week (preferably 3-4 business day turn-around).

We have mockups both for full-resolution Web and responsive mobile layouts, and the implementation would ideally use Bootstrap as a base framework.
