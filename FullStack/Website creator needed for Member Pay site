Website creator needed for Member Pay site
------------------

Looking to develop a website that would have functions as follows: A Free part, A Member part, a place someone can sign up to pay to become a Member, Log in as a Member, the ability for Live Video to run (in a widget if possible?), a section for recorded videos and podcasts, an area for people to be able to post Reviews, Read Reviews (similar to PissedConsumer.com). Some of the features will be for Pay Members only. Others will be available to the public. The Member "Sign up" area will need to be connected to a service that will handle credit cards.

Hi, I grabbed your idea and have a quick question after reading your requirement. 

`What makes you to develop your own platform ? I can shortly list similar apps in the online. What will make your platform unique or is it for private use ?`

I always would like to discuss & understand about your main objectives before it comes to development and about development, you can rely on me since I'm a fullstack developer equipped with modern web standards.

So let's discuss and make something great together!

Best,
Gabe

What Member/Pay websites have you created that may be somewhat similar to PissedConsumer.com?
Over the last 5 years I have worked in bay-area start-ups with the title of fullstack developer. 
In the meanwhile, I've also worked in various SAAS platforms including www.corva.ai
Payment integrations like paypal, stripe would be straight forward to me.
