Full stack Develop
--------------
Looking for fullstack developer with Node experience. Angular, Javascript, and MongoDB also preffered.

------------

Hi, 

I'm a professional full-stack developer with 5+ years of experience.
Over the last 5 years I have worked in bay-area start-ups with the title of fullstack developer and have a proud portfolio projects built in modern web standards.

You can check my works here:
www.corva.ai
www.wantable.com
www.juniper.net

As an expert in core javascript, various front-end MVC (Angular, React, Vue) and back-end frameworks(RoR, PHP, Node.js), I'm sure I'm right candidate for this position.

I worked for private companies for 5 years before I turned into freelancer so I have good communication skills, team spirit, consistency & never give up. Also, I'm familiar and trained at scrum and agile methodology.

I can work in EST and keep you updated with my progress everyday once you allow me to work on this.

Could I possibly meet you and discuss the project more in detail?

I'd appreciate if you could afford some time for me.

Best,
Gabe
