Hi, 
I'm a full-stack developer with 5+ years of commercial experience.

You can check my works here:
www.corva.ai
www.wantable.com
www.juniper.net

As an expert in core javascript, various front-end MVC (Angular, React) and back-end frameworks(RoR, PHP, Node.js), I'm sure I'm right candidate for this position.

I worked for private companies for 5 years before I turned into freelancer so I have good communication skills, team spirit, consistency & never give up. Also, I'm familiar and trained at scrum and agile methodology.

Could I possibly meet you and discuss more in detail?

I'd appreciate if you could afford some time for me.

Best,
Gabe
