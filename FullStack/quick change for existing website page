Hi,
I'm a FULL STACK developer with 5+ years of experience in core javascript, php, wordpress and many others.

Over the last 5 years I've developed & participated 5+ projects using modern web technologies and some of them are:
www.wantable.com
www.corva.ai
www.juniper.net

I've worked in private company for 5 years before I turned into freelancer so I have good communications, team spirit, consistency & never give up. 

In terms of my skills and experience, I have no doubt about that I'm a right candidate for this position. 

Could we possibly meet and discuss further details ? 

I look forward to develop this into a long-term relationship with you. 

Best,
Gabe
