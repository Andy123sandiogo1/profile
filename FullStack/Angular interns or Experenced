Hi,
I'm a web developer with 5+ years of experience in Angular4+,PHP, Laravel, RoR and etc..

As an expert in core javascript, various front-end MVC (Angular, React), back-end frameworks(PHP, Larave, Node.js) and SQL(MySql, Mariodb, MongoDB), I'm sure I'm right candidate for this position. 

I have carefully read your job description and fully understood it. I can start to build this webpage right away once after you hire me. 

My Skills:
* Can deploy Angular on an Linux Server: yes
* Angular 6 Experience (at least A4/5): yes
* CSS Experience: yes
* JS Experience: yes
* Must be able to work with APIs: yes
* Can work with GitLab: yes
* Can setup CI process in GitLab: y
* Available Now to Start Full-time: y
* Can work weekends in the start (At lease for first 2 weeks and either Sat or Sun): y

I have an excellent experience in web crawling/scraping using phantomjs, slimerjs and casperjs, and I also have developed websites/apps (www.corva.ai) using chart libraries including D3.js and amcharts.js.


I'm also familiar and trained at scrum and agile methodology and use git for version control. I've worked in private company before I turned into the freelancer so I have a good communication skill.

Could I possibly meet you and discuss the project more in detail?

I'd appreciate if you could afford some time for me.

Best,
Gabe

Can you view a Mockup and make nearly pixel perfect match AND test your work?

The answer we need is how many HOURS or MIN - If you have to do a GET call and bind to a ng-datatable from a theme. How long would it take you to do that?
I can work 7 days a week, and what does 'MIN'? Is Min $?
Maybe, it will take 0.04s to do a GET call.
