-As a professional, what is your long-term goals as a freelancer?
-I wanna create a startup myself and I'm also interested in other techs like crypto currency these days.

But for now, I wanna concentrate on freelancer stuff and earn more experience.
-Would you mind taking the Upwork PHP test for me?
-Ok.
Not a problem for me.
Do you want me to take it now ?
- I would appreciate it if you could take it today, yes.
- Can you also describe your personality style for me?
- I think I have to take some personality test myself :)
-No worries. I must run now, but if you could message me when you've finished that test, so I can review the results. I appreciate you taking the time to chat today, Gabe.
-Hello, Gabe. How are you?
-Hi,
I'm good. thanks. How are you ?
-I'm good. Thank you.
We appreciate you putting in for our full stack developer role. My name is Christopher.
-Yes, I'd be happy to. For this project, we have a home-grown web application that services a number of users for turning in assignments and having them scored.

It is primarily written in PHP and uses MariaDB.
-Let's take a hypothetical example: you've been assigned to triage a bug related to a scheduled item in the product where the search bar does not find it. But it exists in the system and can be located by scrolling through all scheduled items. Can you describe your thought process in triaging such a bug?
-So first, I'll check that the query to db works fine and confirm it returns that record.

If it's correct, I'll track down into api/controller.

Or else I'll update query, etc..

These days, I'm writing specs and test cases in most of the projects.

TDD, BDD
