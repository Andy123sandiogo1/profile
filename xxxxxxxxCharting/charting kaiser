kaiser [8:44 AM]

How are you ?

do u receive the payment?

Gabe [8:38 PM]
oh, I didn't check yet.

Gabe [8:56 AM]
Hi Kaiser, How are you?
If you are online, please ping me.
I am going to explain about range error message.

kaiser [8:57 AM]
I see

Gabe [8:59 AM]
If user select too small range(i.e user selected less range than 1s), it can't be displayed graph.

kaiser [8:59 AM]
y

Gabe [9:00 AM]
so, at that time, i have displayed error message

kaiser [9:00 AM]
I used to select a range (from the graph , maybe 10 or more sec), but no show
maybe at that range , there is no data point in DB?

Gabe [9:01 AM]
Oh.. I have updated recently.
I have updated it and uploaded in your server.
so you can test it.
Hi

kaiser [9:03 AM]
ok
thx
sorry I am too busy recenbtlt
recently

Gabe [9:03 AM]
If API data does not exist, It will not display and show error message.

kaiser [9:03 AM]
ok

Gabe [9:03 AM]
"Data is not exist"

kaiser [9:03 AM]
or there is another way to do
we just skip this selection, return to pervious range
because there is no more data
so user can not deep-in

Gabe [9:09 AM]
Hi
after user select chart range, do you want to make the function which return to first staging?

kaiser [9:10 AM]
I think this is an option, because user could select the range again from the top-right botton

Gabe [9:16 AM]
Ok. i will update the function as soon

Gabe [8:53 AM]
Hi
How are you?
I am gonna update  new issue in this sunday.
