-Hi Kaiser, How are you?
 If you are online, please ping me.
 I am going to explain about range error message.
- I see
- If user select too small range(i,e user selected less range than 1s), it can't be displayed graph.
- y
- so, at that time, I have displayed error message
- I used to select a range (from the graphy, maybe 10 or more sec), but no slow
	maybe at that range, there is no data point in DB.
Oh... I have updated recently.
I have updated it and uploaded in your server.
so you can test it.
