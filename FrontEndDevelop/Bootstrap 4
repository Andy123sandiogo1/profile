Bootstrap 4

-------------
Hi,

I need an excact replica of the contact forms with the same functions on the following URL: 

https://www.trademarkprotector.com/

The first form ist the multistep form in the header section.

The second form you can find above the footer at the end of the page.

We need the same style and functions of the two forms developed with bootstrap 4. When clicking on the submit button the user should be redirected to the following thank-you page: 

https://www.trademarkprotector.com/message-received/

The goal is to do a relaunch of the website. Here you can see the new template, so that you can orientate, where the new contact forms will be implemented:

Thank you in advance for your offer.

Kind regards,
Aldin
