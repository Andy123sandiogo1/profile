Reactjs export

--------------


Hi, 
I'm a web developer with 5+ years of experience in core javascript, react.js, angular 4+ and many others..

I'm in love of react.js and favor it among all other frontend MVC frameworks and usually use it together with redux,... more

 I worked for private companies for 5 years before I turned into freelancer so I have good communication skills, team spirit, consistency & never give up. Also, I'm familiar and trained at scrum and agile methodology and use git for version control.

Could I possibly meet you and discuss the project more in detail?

I'd appreciate if you could afford some time for me.

Best,
Gabe
