Merge React code to the main website.
---------
We have a react sign up page, that we need to merge into our main website. The website is currently programmed in angular, JS and HTML. Currently, the main website uses a different react version to the sign-up page.

Why do you insist react signup page in angular application ???

I suggest you to write signup page in angular and it's right thing to do for the best practice, better maintenance and performance.

If you agree with me, I can quickly turn around and write signup page in angular!

Best,
