Hi, 
I'm a full-stack developer with 5+ years of experience in javascript, React, Node/Express and its frameworks.

I have carefully read your job description and fully understood it. I can start to build this webpage right away once after you hire me.

If you wanna see my previous work, here're some:

I can finish this project as soon as possible within a day and I'd appreciate if you hire me.

I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,
