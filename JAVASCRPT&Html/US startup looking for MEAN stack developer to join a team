We are looking for a full-stack developer to join our remote development team and help us to build an HR platform with MEAN stack. We want a team member who strives to develop a first class codebase using Angular and Node.js best practices.

We have launched our product last week and now need some extra help to build new functionality :)

You'll be working on 3 separate repositories: user dashboard, an admin control panel and the underlying API. They are all built with Angular 5 and Node.js with Express framework.

We are looking for someone who is comfortable with back-end development and is a rock-star when it comes to Angular. Prior experience with ngrx is mandatory.

What you'll do:
- Maintain and add new features to an existing application built on Angular 5+ with Ngrx core and effects.
- Play a key role in building and shaping the product we are building.
- Write e2e and unit-tests.
- Consume RESTful web service secured with JWT token. 
- Implement new features and optimize background processes
- Help us make decisions about UI/UX.

You'll be working with highly technical team on an early-stage US based startup. This is an opportunity for long-term contract for the right freelancer.

Please include the examples of your past work in Angular (preferably open-source projects) in your cover letter.

This position is open for individual freelancers only.
