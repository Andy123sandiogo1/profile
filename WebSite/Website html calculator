Hello.

I'm a professional web developer with 5+ years of experience.
Over the last 5 years I've developed & participated 5+ projects using React.js, AngularJS, RoR, etc..

You can check my works here:

www.corva.ai
www.juniper.net

As an expert in core javascript, various front-end MVC (Angular, Backbone and Ember) and front-end coding(HTML5/css3/jQuery/Bootstrap), I can implement almost anything customers want and your calculator is no exception.

I've got thorough your requirements 100% and I'm sure I can deliver you best result as soon as possible.

I worked for private company for 5 years before I turned into freelancer so I have good communication skills, team spirit, consistency & never give up. 

I'm familiar and trained at scrum and agile methodology and use git for version control.

Could I possibly meet and discuss more details about this project?

I'd appreciate if you can afford some time for me.

Thanks.
