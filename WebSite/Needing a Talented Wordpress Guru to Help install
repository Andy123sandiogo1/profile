Needing a Talented Wordpress Guru to Help install and Get up and Running.
------------------

One night, as a couple lays down for bed, the husband starts rubbing his wife’s arm.

The wife turns over and says “I’m sorry honey, I’ve got a gynecologist appointment tomorrow and I want to stay fresh.”

The husband, rejected, turns over.

A few minutes later, he rolls back over and taps his wife again.

“Do you have a dentist appointment tomorrow too?”

Hi,
I'm a full-stack developer with 5+ years of wordpress experience.
I'm well-versed in wordpress theme/plugin development and customization and also, I can integrate custom widgets.

Please check my previous wordpress work here:

As an expert in wordpress with commercial experience and deep knowledge, I have an excellent experience in developing the framework, so that I think I'm the right candidate for your project and I can deliver the best result.

Could we possibly meet and discuss more details about this project?

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.
Thanks,
