Vue and Laravel
---------------
Hi,
I'm a web developer with 5+ years of experience in PHP, Laravel, Vue, etc.

As an expert in core javascript, various front-end MVC (Angular, Vue), back-end frameworks(PHP, Larave) and SQL(MySql, Mariodb, MongoDB), I'm sure I'm right candidate for this position. 

I have carefully read your job description and fully understood it. I can start to build this webpage right away once after you hire me. 

Could I possibly meet you and discuss the project more in detail?

I'd appreciate if you could afford some time for me.

Best,
Gabe
