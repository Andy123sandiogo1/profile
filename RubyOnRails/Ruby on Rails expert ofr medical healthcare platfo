Are you looking for a veteran ruby on rails developer with fast turnaround ? If so, you don't need to look around any more because you're already reading down about right one... 

I'm a developer with ruby on rails experience since 2.0 and now I'm a veteran ruby on rails developer with many other hybrid technologies. 

If you regard your first task is simple and fast, I'll take it free and wanna prove about what I'm capable of.

I'm really motivated and eager to work on this project and keep a long-term relationship with you if possible.

Just drop me a message and you'll find a great potential. 

Best
