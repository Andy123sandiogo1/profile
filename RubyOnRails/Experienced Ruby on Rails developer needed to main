Experienced Ruby on Rails developer needed to maintain and provide support for established e-Commerce platform
--------------------
Looking for a developer experienced with Facebook's marketing API to maintain and extend a custom Ruby on Rails e-Commerce platform. 

We're undergoing development on several new features, so as our primary developer pivots to other projects, we need a dedicated developer for the platform to monitor the system, handle errors, fix bugs, work on small features, and to act as as a support and knowledge base for other developers as they work on features for the platform. 

To reiterate, the platform we're using is a custom Ruby on Rails application - this is not Shopify, Magento, et cetera. We're using a PostgreSQL database to serve the backend.

---------------------

Are you looking for someone who can lead and help you make it success ? 

I'm a ruby on rails developer with experience in facebook graph api, rails 3/4/5, spree, elastic search, etc.. 

I wanna join to be part of your team and help each other, succeed with this project.

You can check my previous work here :

So is your eCommerce initially completed and in maintenance ? I'd like to discuss about project in more details regarding like its scale, stacks, your team, etc.. 

I hope I could help in every way and look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Thanks,
Gabe
