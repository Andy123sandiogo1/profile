Hi, 

I'm a veteran full-stack RoR developer with 6+ years of experience since its version 2 and I have great portfolio using rails, react, angular.

Please check my previous works:

www.wantable.com

I've worked in a private company for 5 years before I turned into freelancer so I have good communication, consistency and never give up. 

I always have scalability, maintainability in mind and I'm familiar with BDD, TDD.

I'm really interested and eager to work on your project and possibly look forward a long-term relationship.

Could we possibly meet and discuss further details ? 

Best
Gabe
