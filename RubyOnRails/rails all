Hi,

I'm a ruby on rails developer with experience in rails 3/4/5, core javascript, sidekiq, rspec, etc..

I'm a developer with ruby on rails experience since 2.0 and now I'm a veteran ruby on rails developer with many other hybrid technologies. 

Hereâ€™s our expectations for your experience:
- At least 4-year experience in Ruby on Rails
- SQL(MySql, Mariodb, MongoDB)
- Ability to write tests with good code coverage
- Fluent English level
- Expert-level fluency with Javascript and ECMA6 best practices
- Familiarity with common git workflow

I worked for private companies for 5 years before I turned into freelancer so I have good communication skills, team spirit, consistency & never give up. Also, I'm familiar and trained at scrum and agile methodology.

I hope I could help in every way and look forward to hearing from you soon. 

Thanks,
Gabe
