 Here, I'm sending JS snippet to parse CSV :
function CSVToArray( strData, strDelimiter ){
strDelimiter = (strDelimiter || ",");

var objPattern = new RegExp(
(
"(\\" + strDelimiter + "|\\r?\\n|\\r|^)" +
"(?:\"([^\"]*(?:\"\"[^\"]*)*)\"|" +
"([^\"\\" + strDelimiter + "\\r\\n]*))"
),
"gi"
);

var arrData = [[]];
var arrMatches = null;

while (arrMatches = objPattern.exec( strData )){

var strMatchedDelimiter = arrMatches[ 1 ];

if (
strMatchedDelimiter.length &&
strMatchedDelimiter !== strDelimiter
) {
arrData.push( [] );
}

var strMatchedValue;

if (arrMatches[ 2 ]){

strMatchedValue = arrMatches[ 2 ].replace(
new RegExp( "\"\"", "g" ),
"\""
);

} else {

strMatchedValue = arrMatches[ 3 ];

}

arrData[ arrData.length - 1 ].push( strMatchedValue );
}

return( arrData );
}
