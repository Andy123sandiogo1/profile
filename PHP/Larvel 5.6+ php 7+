Hi,
I'm a web developer with 5+ years of experience in PHP, Laravel, Angular.js, etc.. 

I had used MVC(Model, View, control) function in the  laravel, php and have a lot of experience of using these Laravel patterns such as singltons, observers and focades. I also have a lot of experience of building  ecomerce payments and integrating the large project.

With all my experience and knowledge, I'm sure I'm right candidate for this position. 

I'm also willing to negotiate my hourly rate and as a full-stack developer, I can meet all your requirements. 

Here's some of my previous work samples:

How is your experience with Laravel for API development?
I have a lot of experience of Laravel Restful API experience.

Have you ever built cron / queue jobs using soley Laravel framework?
Yes, I have.
I have ever built and used cron /queue in phone verification program.


How do you manage time precise service executions?
It is normally difficult to get time precise service excutions.
So I solved this problem using processes in a multi-threaded mode.

Payment Industry: What you had to build that basically had to deal with both integration and record tracking
I have a lot of deal with both integration and record tracking in shopify programs

Did you ever have to create a mechanism to integrate into several platforms?
 Example, you have several payment providers but all needs to work on a single payment entry tracking mechanism in your API?
 Yes, I did. But it is not sure. If you think about it, you'll find a good way.
