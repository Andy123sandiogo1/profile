amchart 4 for network traffic graph

---------------

We are looking for a web developer who knows about amchart4.
The project need to works with a back-end API which sending the NIC traffic information and draw the NIC tx/rx traffic and its packets graph in near realtime.
You could check the demo, this is what we expected.

the API return something like this , the API need to be called every 2 seconds:

"timestamp": "2018-08-01T06:15:09.553Z" 
{
"interface": "eth0",
"rx_packets": 104263928,
"tx_packets": 53316905,
"rx_bytes": 76133928876,
"tx_bytes": 41395777402
},
{
"interface": "eth1",
"rx_packets": 0,
"tx_packets": 0,
"rx_bytes": 0,
"tx_bytes": 0
},

----------------------------

Perfect ! Please check real-time amCharts I've written to embed in wix page here:

Hi, Cheng
I'm Gabe Nunez, a web developer from US with 5+ years of experience. 

I'm well-versed in amcharts and have proven work history of writing dozens of real-time apps using amcharts.
I've worked in a project named Corva(www.corva.ai) and we used amcharts to visualize real-time rig data. 

With my experience, I think I'm perfectly fit for this project and my budget is also negotiable since I'm new to upwork.
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best,
Gabe

--------- QUESTIONS -----------
- How do you calculate the traffic from the API?
The api returns timestamp, tx_byte, rx_byte, tx_packet, rx_packet.
I call the api and accumulate the data I receive in an array and update graph data every each time array is updated.. 
If array elements count is exceed the time range, I can shift elements to push new one. 
average, maximum, current... more

- Do you have any questions about the job description?
Nothing actually. It's too obvious for me.

- Do you have suggestions to make this project run successfully?
Calling api every 2 seconds sounds a bit too much for me. In my previous project, we introduced web socket for real-time graphs.
