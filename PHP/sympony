Hi,
I'm a web developer with 5+ years of experience in PHP, Sympony 4+ Laravel 5.0+, Angular 4+, etc.. 

I had used MVC(Model, View, control) function in the  sympony, laravel, php and have a solid understanding of server configurations, reliable plugins, security configuration and backup solutions.

With all my experience and knowledge, I'm sure I'm right candidate for this position. 

I'm also willing to negotiate my hourly rate and as a full-stack developer, I can meet all your requirements. 

Here's some of my previous work samples:

With my experience, I think I'm perfectly fit for this project and my budget is also negotiable since I'm a most experienced freelancer.

Can we possibly meet and discuss further details if possible ?
