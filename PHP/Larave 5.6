Hi,
I'm a web developer with 5+ years of experience in PHP, Laravel 5.0+, Angular 4+, etc.. 

I had used MVC(Model, View, control) function in the  laravel, php and have a lot of experience of using these Laravel patterns such as singltons, observers and focades.

With all my experience and knowledge, I'm sure I'm right candidate for this position. 

I'm also willing to negotiate my hourly rate and as a full-stack developer, I can meet all your requirements. 

Here's some of my previous work samples:
www.wantable.com
www.juniper.net

Can we possibly meet and discuss further details if possible ? 

Best,
Gabe

Did you ever have to create a mechanism to integrate into several platforms?
 Example, you have several payment providers but all needs to work on a single payment entry tracking mechanism in your API?
 Yes, I did. But it is not sure. If you think about it, you'll find a good way.
