Hi,
I'm a web developer with 5+ years of experience in PHP, Laravel, Angular.js, etc.. 

From my past experience, I can use the hook function in wordpress to solve it. It is not difficult!

Here's some of my previous work samples:
www.wantable.com
www.corva.ai
www.juniper.net

With all my experience and knowledge, I'm sure I'm right candidate for this position. 
As an upwork starter, I'm also willing to negotiate my hourly rate and as a full-stack developer, I can meet all your requirements. 

Can we possibly meet and discuss further details if possible ? 

Best,
Gabe
