AngularASample


Hi,
I'm a web developer with 5+ years of experience in Angular, Typescript, Javascript and etc..

As an expert in core javascript, various front-end MVC (Angular, React), back-end frameworks(PHP, Larave, Node.js) and SQL(MySql, Mariodb, MongoDB), I'm sure I'm right candidate for this position. 

I have carefully read your job description and fully understood it. I can start to build this webpage right away once after you hire me. 

I have proud portfolio projects as well. 
- www.corva.ai
- www.wantable.com

I'm also familiar and trained at scrums and agile methodology and use git for version control.

Could I possibly meet you and discuss the project more in detail?

I'd appreciate if you could afford some time for me.

Best,
Gabe
