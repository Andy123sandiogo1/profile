AnguarJs fireBased Frontend and Backend.

I need someone to further develop an online platform.

 -----------------
Hi Ehsan 

You wonder how I knew your name ? Please don't toss my proposal because of the reason that I'm new

I just saw you just posted a single line for job description but it's enough for me because I can excel the others in terms of skill set especially javascript and its MVC frameworks including angularJS

I have questions for you before sharing my past experience & projects.
- What are you gonna to continue to develop specifically ? 
- Can you provide me any link or assets to browse your online platform ? 
- In which language is your online platform written ? 

Can we possibly meet on skype or upwork messenger and discuss further details ? 

Thanks, 
Gabe
