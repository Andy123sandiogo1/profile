Expert Angular-Typescript Developer
----------
I am looking for an expert Angular (2 or 4) developer who has experience working with a team to support a point-of-sale and inventory management platform that enables retail operations. The platform is a live system that enables business in specific industries to process thousands of transactions daily, manage inventory and resources, and minimize the transaction time at each point-of-sale terminal. As such, having a robust, intuitive and scalable user interface that works seamlessly with back-end services is of critical importance.

Responsibilities
- Take raw front-end (HTML/CSS) files and implement views cleanly into Angular codebase
- Write modular code to enable Angular views to interact efficiently with back-end services
- Implement necessary logic
- Use best practices to ensure consistency of front-end elements and interactions
- Generate beautiful reports and data visualizations to enable clients to manage their businesses
- Integrate third-party libraries and services into platform

Requirements
- Expert-level fluency with Javascript and ECMA6 best practices
- Expert-level fluency with Angular 2 or 4
- Fluency with CSS and best practices
- Understanding of front-end development and implementation
- Knowledge of Git version control
- Bachelor's degree in computer science, engineering, or equivalent

Hi, 

I understand all my responsibilities and can meet all your requirements except I'm yet to earn BS. But 5 years of commercial experience and 9+ years of overall programming history can easily cover a deficit. 

So here's why you should regard me as all-rounds developer for your project:
- A big fan of angular since js 1.5, aware of its improvement for each version(2,4,5,6). good to go with rxjs and ngrx
- Typescript vs Flow ? I easily chose typescript and fluent with it.
- fluenct with HTML/ERB/HAML and CSS/SCSS
- efficiency in d3.js, amChart.js for visualization
- 3rd party integration like AWS, FB, twitter, stripe, etc..
- follows good coding convention and good practioner for BDD/TDD

I'd like to hear further details about your project and happy to discuss in detail.

Looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Thanks,
Gabe
