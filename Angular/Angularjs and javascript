Angularjs and javascript
---------------------
Hi,

I just saw you just posted a single line for job description but it's enough for me because I can excel the others in terms of skill set especially javascript and its MVC frameworks including angularJS

I am an expert in core javascript, various front-end MVC (Angular, React), back-end frameworks(RoR, Larave, Node.js) and SQL(MySql, Mariodb, MongoDB).

Can we possibly meet on upwork messenger and discuss further details ? 

Thanks, 
Gabe

1. Describe your experience with Angular in 3-4 sentences?
	AngularJS is architecture on 3 components such as the template(view), the scope(model) and controller.
	In angular, the most important is a decorator, and decorator is the core concept when developing an angular framework with version 2+,and there are 4 different types of decorators such as class decorators, property decorators, method decorators and parameter decorators. And then, writing CLI command, we can generate a components in Angular.
	We also used the elements which present in the component directory structure - module.ts, component.ts and component.html as well as ngFor and ngIf directives. ngRoute module is used when you want to navigate through different pages of application. 
2. Tell about advantages of Angular vs other frameworks if you had a chance to work with them.
	- Component-based architecture
		Angular consist of a lots of components.
	- RxJS
		You can leverage RxJS with other frameworks that function with front-end (React.JS) or back-end operations (Node.JS), but in Angular RxJS is a necessity
	- Google Long-Term Support
	- Two-way data binding
