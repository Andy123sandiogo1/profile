HI Gabe, I have two sites lakengren.com and yankeetrace.com. I would like for someone to look over both and tell me optimizations I need done. Currently the sites have large videos(not my call, client requested).
However. I want to make sure the bones of both sites are buttoned up and ready to for handover to client.
So any loading issues, SEO problems, etc.

Basically I want another set of experienced eyes on it.

Let me know if your interested. Thank you.

I dont quite grasp. Images in Wordpress, sizing them to the correct size.

Hi,

I've just visited your two websites. I've marked issues in red rectangles in doc.

We could meet and discuss more details about this project asap.

Thank you, Jake.

Thanks for taking a look.

I realize I have a video issue. The client has requested this video against my advice. It is too big. However these images. I dont understand how wordpress uses images.

It tried to resize them etc. The Theme I used was Pressville

Hi,

There are some ways how to optimize the images and videos in wordpress.

One is to use the plugin in wordpress, another is to customize its, reduce the number of posts on the page (I like showing between 5-7), remove unnecessary sharing widgets from the home page (include them only in posts) and etc.

In order to do, we must find the important specs.
