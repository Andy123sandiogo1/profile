We need a long-term developer to help maintain and implement new modules on our e-commerce site. We are a well-established company. Easy to work with. Our projects are relatively simple and always planned so the deadlines are somehow not so tight except of course, for emergencies.

Thank you very much!

I look forward to develop this into a long-term relationship with you. 

I have proud portfolio projects as well.

I always would like to discuss & understand about your main objectives before it comes to development and about development, you can rely on me since I'm a fullstack developer equipped with modern web standards.

So let's discuss and make something great together!

Best,
Gabe
