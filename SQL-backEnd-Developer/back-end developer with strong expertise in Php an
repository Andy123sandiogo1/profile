back-end developer with strong expertise in Php and zend framework
-------------
Need immediate help with existing web-based software to fix error logs and script errors. I own a small SaaS company. The software runs on PHP, ZendFramework 1.8, MySQL. I have a developer I currently work with, but he's overloaded with his main job right now, so I'm looking for someone who can jump in and be more available since our business is growing. I'd want to somehow connect you with my current developer so he can confirm the person we bring on would be a good match. 

I'm in PST zone (CA), so I'd prefer someone in the same time zone, and strong English speaker to ensure clear communication. Quick response times are also required since we have paying customers who need issues fixed in a short time frame since it affects their live service.
--------------------
Are you looking for someone in CA with fast turnaround ? It's perfect!
