JavaScript(SSO)
-----------

Hi, 
I'm a web developer from Livermore, CA with 5+ years of experience in Javascript and other web programming languages. 

Previously, I have developed websites/apps including SSO(single sign on),  

I have proud portfolio projects as well. 
- www.corva.ai
- www.wantable.com

Once you hire me, I can quickly work on your project and deliver a good solution for you.
I'm really eager to work on this project and look forward to hearing back from you.

Best,
Gabe
