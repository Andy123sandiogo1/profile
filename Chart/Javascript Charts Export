Javascript Charts Export

------------

We have an existing SaaS service and are looking to spiff up the UI with a collection of charts. I'm looking to hire a developer skilled in using one or more of the popular JavaScript charting libraries (D3, ChartJS, etc). You will be creating a collection of JavaScript classes to render these images from sample data we'll provide. 

Most of these charts should be quite simple (bar charts, gauges, line charts with moving average, etc). They should all use a common CSS theme, and you should have an excellent sense of design.

Please do not respond if you don't have very strong experience with charts. You must be able to provide samples of prior work with one or more of the popular JS charting libraries. You should be able to explain why you prefer one library over another, and what the differences are between them.

Hi, 
I'm a web developer from Livermore, CA with 5+ years of experience in Javascript and other web programming languages. 

Previously, I have developed websites/apps (www.corva.ai) using chart libraries including D3.js and amcharts.js

As a upwork starter, I can contribute my work at reasonably low price compared to other competitors. 

Once you hire me, I can quickly work on your project and deliver a good solution for you.
I'm really eager to work on this project and look forward to hearing back from you.

Best,
Gabe

Which charting libraries do you work with? Why do you prefer it?
 I've used following chart/graphic libraries in the past: D3, Amcharts, HighCharts

And among those, I'd recommend you D3.js and why ? 

1. It can visualize graphs more beautifully compared to other libraries.
2. It is data-driven, much more flexible and fast using SVG.
3. Above all that, It is all-time favorites from developers with 77.6K github stars.
